# Calculator
A simple Python calculator that can compute mathematical expressions with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squares, square roots, and modulus.  
My GUI uses TKinter to produce a graphical calculator supporting arithmetic, squaring, square roots, modulus, and parentheses.
I implemented clear/evaluate functions for seamless user experience.
